# Data Structures

## Array
One of the data structures that will be used by the parser/interpreter will be arrays. Arrays
will be useful to group a fixed amount of data and run operations on that data. Arrays will follow common
structure with indices starting at 0, and supporting only one data type at a time.

## Lists
Another data structures that will be used by the parser/interpreter will be lists. Lists
will be useful for ordering dynamic data. In other words, if the data does not have a fixed amount, lists will
provide an easy way to add and remove data on the fly. The list will follow a common structure with functionality such
as GET, REMOVE, CONTAINS, REMOVE_BY_VALUE, and ADD.

## Trees
The last data structure that will be used by the parser/interpreter will be trees. Trees will
be useful to group data that have hierarchical relationships. With trees we can also run many traversals
such as BFS and DFS to search for data that we might want. Trees will follow a binary pattern where each parent node
can have 0,1 or 2 child nodes.
